This document describes the new features of vsftpdx which are not present in the original vsftpd. Check out the [http://vsftpd.beasts.org/#features vsftpd homepage] for the inherited features.

*Database for virtual users*

If the configuration option _sqlite_enable=YES_ is set, the server will handle the user authentication during the login phase using a local SQLite database. The default name for this database is _site.db_. The included script _createdb.sh_ can be used to create a new default database. (1)

*Log to database*

If the configuration option _sqlite_log=YES_ is set, the server will write all log entries to the SQLite database (table _vsf_log_) instead of text files. (1)

*Stealth mode*

If the configuration option _stealth_mode_enable=YES_ is set, the server will drop any incoming connection if the remote IP address does not match any IP mask in the database without any message to the client.



(1) Requires SQLite support, which is enabled using the definition _#define VSF_BUILD_SQLITE_ in _builddefs.h_ during compile time.
