#summary How to install vsftpdx
#labels Phase-Deploy,Featured

===Install required packages===
The following packages are required to compile and execute the program:

*Ubuntu/Debian Linux*
  * libc-dev
  * libssl-dev
  * libsqlite3-dev
  * libcap-dev
  * sqlite3

*Cygwin*
  * gcc-core
  * make
  * openssl
  * openssl-devel
  * sqlite3 (libraries and sqlite3.exe are included in lib/sqlite3/cygwin)

===Build===
Edit _builddefs.h_ with a text editor and set the compilation options you want. Run _make_ to compile the program.

===Create a new database===
Use the include script _createdb.sh_ or run the following command manually _sqlite3 site.db < createdb.sql_. This creates a new database with the name _site.db_. The current version of vsftpd expects the file to be in the same directory as the executable.

===Edit the configuration===
Edit the included file _vsftpd.conf_ with a text editor and set the options you like.

===Create an SSL certificate (optional)===
{{{
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 7300 -newkey rsa:2048 \
   -keyout ./site.pem -out ./site.pem
}}}

===Run===
_./vsftpd ./vsftpd.conf_
